## 1. Coding Clinic: "I Do, We Do, You Do"

### "I Do" — The Instructor Demonstration: Sliding-Window Semantic Chunking
When chunking unstructured text, naive string slicing (`text[0:500]`) frequently splits words and clauses in half. The professional standard is **word-level sliding window chunking with overlap**:

```python
def chunk_text_by_words(text: str, chunk_size: int = 50, overlap: int = 15) -> list[str]:
    """Splits a body of text into overlapping word chunks."""
    words = text.split()
    chunks = []
    
    start = 0
    while start < len(words):
        end = min(start + chunk_size, len(words))
        chunk = " ".join(words[start:end])
        chunks.append(chunk)
        if end == len(words):
            break
        start += (chunk_size - overlap)
        
    return chunks

sample = "The high pressure turbocharger feed line was found to have micro cracks. " * 8
chunks = chunk_text_by_words(sample, chunk_size=20, overlap=5)
print(f"Generated {len(chunks)} overlapping chunks.")
print(f"Chunk 0: {chunks[0]}")
print(f"Chunk 1: {chunks[1]}")
```

### "We Do" — Guided Class Practice: Pre-Filtering with Structured Metadata
In enterprise RAG, vector search should be narrowed down using structured SQL metadata before or during similarity scoring:

```python
# Sample structured chunk dictionary:
records = [
    {"id": "c1", "truck_id": "TRUCK-101", "text": "Engine oil pressure normal during road test."},
    {"id": "c2", "truck_id": "TRUCK-219", "text": "Whining noise reported at 1800 rpm near turbo housing."},
    {"id": "c3", "truck_id": "TRUCK-304", "text": "Brake pad thickness measured at 4mm on steer axle."}
]

# Guided Exercise: Filter to only 'TRUCK-219' chunks before vector similarity:
target_truck = "TRUCK-219"
filtered_pool = [rec for rec in records if rec["truck_id"] == target_truck]
print(f"Filtered pool contains {len(filtered_pool)} records for truck {target_truck}.")
```

### "You Do" — Autonomous Applied Problem
Now, apply these principles to build an enterprise RAG ingestion engine that processes real fleet maintenance logs and uncovers safety-critical failure modes.

## 3. 100-Point Rubric Table

| Criteria | Points | Full Mastery (100%) | Minor Flaw (75%) | Unacceptable (0%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Challenge 1: Header Ingestion** | 25 pts | Correctly parses all 4 log blocks into structured dictionaries with VIN, work order, mileage, and notes. | Ignores one metadata field (e.g. mileage cast to int fails). | Fails to parse records; regex crashes or truncates text. |
| **Challenge 2: Semantic Chunking** | 25 pts | Correct sliding window word algorithm preserving overlap; tags each chunk with parent ID. | Chunks split words in half or overlap is negative. | Returns single monolithic chunk per document. |
| **Challenge 3: Dense Vector Embeddings** | 25 pts | Computes 384-d embeddings using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`; enforces unit L2 normalization. | Embeddings not normalized, distorting cosine metric. | Uses random vectors or crash during model initialization. |
| **Challenge 4: Hybrid Retrieval Engine** | 25 pts | Successfully retrieves Truck #219 log with similarity score > 0.55; supports exact metadata filtering. | Retrieves correct record but metadata filter is broken. | Top hit is wrong truck or score < 0.30. |
